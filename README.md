# PICO-8 Language Server

Full language support for the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)
dialect of Lua. 

The goal is to have all the features you'd expect in a full-fledged language
server, such as [the one for Lua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua),
but specifically tailored for a frictionless PICO-8 experience.

# Feature highlights

Full support for `#include` statements:

### Technical Note

This extension uses the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/),
so while it's mainly made for VSCode, it could also be used for other editors
such as NeoVim, Atom, etc.

## Implemented Features

- Syntax highlighting
- Syntax errors
- Warnings on undefined variable usage
- Find symbol in document
- Go to definition
- Find references
- Hover support for built-in functions
- Auto-completion
- Signature help
- support for `#include`ing other files

## Planned features

- Snippets for common idioms (functions, loops, #include, etc.)
- Hover support/signature help for user-defined functions/variables
