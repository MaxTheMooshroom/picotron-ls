Full language support for the [Picotron](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php) dialect of Lua.

The goal is to have all the features you'd expect in a full-fledged language
server, such as [the one for Lua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua),
but specifically tailored for a frictionless Picotron development experience.

Picotron extends the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) environment. Support for
Picotron ***must*** begin with support for PICO-8. That's why this project is forked from
[pico8-ls](https://github.com/japhib/pico8-ls), as they've already done most of the legwork
for pico-8 support.

## Support for other platforms

This extension uses the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/),
so while it's mainly made for VSCode, it could also be used for other editors
such as NeoVim, Atom, etc.

I don't have any experience setting up language extensions for platforms other than VSCode, so currently
looking for help with that. See tips and support thread on the issue for various editors:
- [Neovim](https://github.com/japhib/pico8-ls/issues/34)
- [Sublime Text](https://github.com/japhib/pico8-ls/issues/44)

## Changelog

[Changelog has been moved to a separate file.](https://github.com/japhib/pico8-ls/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Development

Please follow the official [Language Server Extension Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide)
to understand how to develop VS Code language server extension.
